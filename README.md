- Developed a React and Tailwind-based GIF generator with two sections: one for generating random GIFs and another for generating GIFs based on user-entered text<br>
- Utilized the Giphy developer option to fetch GIFs via API calls<br>
- Implemented a spinner that displays while waiting for the GIF to be fetched<br>
